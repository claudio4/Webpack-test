# Webpack-test
This is a simple test of webpack with dummy code.

For run it you just have download the necesary module by using np,
```
npm install 
```
After that you only have start the project:
```
npm start
```
That runs a webserver in localhost at port **8080**, you must enter at /build directoy in the webserver.

Also if you prefer you can just build the code by using:
```
npm run build
```
You can see the result in *build/bundle.js*.
